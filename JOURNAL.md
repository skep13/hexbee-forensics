## Development log

### Entry 1 — Platform core (Hive)
**Time:** _(fill in)_

Built the heart of the Hive on a Raspberry Pi–friendly, 1 GB-RAM-conscious
design:

- SQLite schema + thread-safe wrapper (WAL mode, single lock).
- **Evidence integrity via a SHA-256 hash chain** — each event commits to the
  entire history before it, so any edit/deletion breaks verification.
- Event **normalization** (accepts ISO-8601 or epoch timestamps; per-type
  severity table).
- Single write path (`store_event`) feeding an event-driven **incident
  correlation engine** (severity ≥ 2 opens/extends an incident and pulls in
  recent same-device context).
- **Timeline** reconstruction, **case management** (`HB-YYYY-NNNN`), **auth +
  RBAC** (PBKDF2, tokens, viewer/investigator/administrator), **search**, and
  an **append-only audit log**.

*Decision:* hash-chain over per-event hashes, because a single hash proves a
record wasn't corrupted but not that nothing was deleted or reordered.

### Entry 2 — Web dashboard + REST API
**Time:** _(fill in)_

One Flask app serving both the analyst dashboard and a versioned `/api/v1`
REST surface, sharing a single token auth path. HTML/JSON/CSV **report
engine**. Honey-on-black themed, server-rendered templates.

### Entry 3 — Queen analyst CLI + Scout firmware & simulator
**Time:** _(fill in)_

- **Queen** (`hexbee-queen`): stdlib-only REST client + CLI for cases,
  incidents, timeline, search, reports.
- **Scout firmware** (ESP-IDF, C): Wi-Fi station + auto-reconnect, SNTP,
  MQTT publish (QoS 1), heartbeat, and a RAM **offline event buffer** that
  flushes in order on reconnect. `usb_watch` runs in simulation mode until the
  TinyUSB acquisition path is validated on real silicon.
- **Scout simulator** (Python): emits the exact JSON a real Scout sends, so
  the full pipeline runs with no hardware (`quiet`/`usb`/`incident` scenarios).

### Entry 4 — Deployment + first end-to-end test
**Time:** _(fill in)_

Raspberry Pi `install.sh` (Mosquitto, dedicated user, virtualenv, DB init,
systemd services that auto-start headless), systemd units, and docs. Ran the
simulator against a live Hive: events → auto-correlated incident → case →
report → verified hash chain. First green test suite.

### Entry 5 — Branding + IOC engine
**Time:** _(fill in)_

- Integrated the official **HexBee Forensics logo** (favicon, navbar, login,
  embedded in reports) with generated size variants.
- **IOC engine**: watchlist (sha256/filename/ip/domain/substring) matched at
  ingest; a hit escalates to critical, opens/extends an incident, tags the
  event, and audit-logs it. Added Devices, IOCs, and Audit pages.

### Entry 6 — Comb forensic triage toolkit (Autopsy/AXIOM-class)
**Time:** _(fill in)_

Queen-side analysis toolkit whose findings upload into the Hive's evidence
chain: magic-byte typing + **extension-mismatch detection**, **file carving**
from raw images, **MBR/GPT** partition parsing, **EXIF/GPS** extraction,
**browser history** (Chrome/Firefox), optional **Sleuth Kit** integration, and
a scan pipeline + branded report.

### Entry 7 — Offline maps, reference library, and local AI
**Time:** _(fill in)_

- **Offline evidence map**: zero-dependency slippy map serving standard
  MBTiles, plotting GPS coordinates recovered from evidence.
- **Offline reference library**: serves ZIM archives (offline Wikipedia) plus
  local HTML/Markdown/PDF field docs.
- **Hive Mind local AI**: case summaries + evidence Q&A via a local Ollama
  model, with a deterministic rule-based fallback (fully offline).

### Entry 8 — iPhone XR field companion + QR evidence labels
**Time:** _(fill in)_

Installable **PWA** at `/field` (Add to Home Screen, no App Store): view open
incidents, photograph evidence **directly into the hash chain**, and per-case
**QR labels** the iPhone camera scans to open a case. Mobile-responsive across
all pages. Test suite grew to **48 passing tests**.

### Entry 9 — Ship prep: Kali setup, docs, LICENSE, hardware BOM
**Time:** _(fill in)_

Kali `setup-kali.sh` for the Queen (pipx + Sleuth Kit), disk-image mounting
workflow docs, a forensic-hygiene fix (browser DB copies are shredded after
reading), MIT `LICENSE`, and a hardware **bill of materials + wiring**
([docs/HARDWARE.md](docs/HARDWARE.md)). Published to GitHub.

### Entry 10 — Scout hardware bring-up (in progress)
**Time:** _(fill in)_

_Next hardware milestone — log as you go:_

- [ ] Flash the firmware onto a physical ESP32-S3 and confirm Wi-Fi + MQTT to
      the Pi (heartbeats appear on the dashboard).
- [ ] Implement the real **TinyUSB** device-mode enumeration on the target PC
      (replace the simulated insertion in `usb_watch.c`).
- [ ] MSC-host triage of an attached USB stick (file metadata → events).
- [ ] Photograph the assembled Scout + a live capture on the dashboard.
- [ ] (Stretch) per-Scout cryptographic identity + event signing; MQTT TLS.

## Hardware used

### 🐝 Scout — ESP32-S3
USB-OTG field agent that plugs into a target computer. Flash storage only,
limited RAM, USB/battery powered. **Constraints:** acquisition and triage
only — no heavy analysis, no databases; everything it sends is small JSON.

### 🏠 Hive — Raspberry Pi 3B+
Always-on, headless evidence hub. Quad-core Cortex-A53, **1 GB RAM**, boots
from USB SSD. **Constraints:** 1 GB RAM forces SQLite over PostgreSQL,
event-driven processing over batch jobs, and memory-capped services.

### 👑 Queen — Lenovo ThinkPad T470 (Kali Linux)
Analyst workstation where heavy analysis (Comb) runs. No significant limits.

### 📱 iPhone XR — field validation terminal
Not an acquisition device: human validation, QR scanning, evidence
photography, and offline field reference via a home-screen web app.

See [docs/HARDWARE.md](docs/HARDWARE.md) for the full BOM, pinout, and
assembly.

## Design principles honoured
- **One write path** — MQTT and REST both funnel through `store_event`, which
  is what makes the hash chain trustworthy.
- **SQLite on 1 GB RAM** — WAL, single lock, event-driven correlation.
- **Stdlib-first** — auth, Queen client, map viewer, and AI/reference
  fallbacks avoid heavy deps so the air-gapped Pi and a bare Kali both work.
- **Fully offline** — maps, reference/Wikipedia, and AI run on the LAN; each
  degrades gracefully without its optional data/model.
- **Evidence hygiene** — browser DBs copied then shredded; targets never
  opened read-write; every analyst action audit-logged.

## What HexBee does when done

A field-deployable DFIR platform where a **Scout** on a suspect machine streams
tamper-evident events to a headless **Hive**, which hash-chains and
auto-correlates them into incidents with timelines; **IOC** watchlists
auto-escalate known-bad indicators; the **Queen** runs **Comb** to triage
seized disk images (carving, partitions, EXIF/GPS, browser history, Sleuth Kit)
straight into the same evidence chain; analysts work cases via web + CLI, plot
GPS on an **offline map**, consult an **offline Wikipedia**, ask a **local AI**
to summarise, and export verifiable reports; and an **iPhone XR** serves as a
field companion for photographing evidence into the chain and scanning case QR
labels — every layer offline, from acquisition to signed report.
